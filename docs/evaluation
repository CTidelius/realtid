* What we learned
It's easier working 4 people instead of 8 (PVG course). The code is just much cleaner now
It's important to agree on a certain protocol so you speak the same "language".
Server and client interactions.
Some of the members were newly introduced to Git (from SVN) and liked it more.
Refreshed knowledge in CSS and HTML.

* Difficulties we faced
Debugging and realizing why a certain byte is wrong in a certain package (jpg sizes were different ones, threw us off the table)
Concurrent access to arrays on server side.
Identifying problems in concurrent programming, because it's difficult to debug and know which threads use which objects and why certain data is corrupted
Sending and reading to and from a socket and catching all exceptions and errors.

* What we would do different if we would have done it again
Would have made it more clear between members on who should focus on what part of the program
Discuss solutions with the whole group

* Final words
It was surprisingly successful. The class diagram was of big help and the whole work process went very smoothly.
