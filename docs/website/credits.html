<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>It's easier working 4 people instead of 10 (PVG course). The code is just much cleaner now.</p>
<p>It's important to agree on a certain protocol so you speak the same "language".
Server and client interactions.</p><p>
Some of the members were newly introduced to Git (from SVN) and liked it more.
Refreshed knowledge in CSS and HTML.</p>

<h2>Difficulties we faced</h2>
<p>Debugging and realizing why a certain byte is wrong in a certain package (jpg sizes were different ones, threw us off the table).</p><p>
Concurrent access to arrays on server side.</p><p>
Identifying problems in concurrent programming, because it's difficult to debug and know which threads use which objects and why certain data is corrupted.</p><p>
Sending and reading to and from a socket and catching all exceptions and errors.</p>

<h2>What we would do different if we would have done it again</h2>
<p>Would have made it more clear between members on who should focus on what part of the program.</p><p>
Discuss solutions with the whole group.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>It was surprisingly successful. The class diagram was of big help and the whole work process went very smoothly.</p>
