		<p>Running the client<br/>
		Client.jar is a runnable JAR-file, to start it just open it with Java runtime or type "java -jar client.jar" in the terminal. There are 3 different checkboxes to change the update rate of images.<br/>
		Auto: The server decides how fast images should be sent. Default is Idle, one image is sent every 5 seconds. If motion is detected on the server all cameras switch to Movie which is about 25 images per second. The UI will also display which camera triggered the latest Movie mode by drawing a red cross underneath the image.<br/>
		Movie: Forces Movie mode on all servers which means they send about 25 images per second.<br/>
		Idle: Forces Idle mode on all servers which means they send an image every 5 seconds.<br/>
		There are also 3 checkboxes to change how the images are synced.<br/>
		Auto: The client decides when to synchronize images. If the newest images were captured within 200ms of each other they will be displayed synchronized. Otherwise the client will switch display them instantly.<br/>
		On: Always display images synchronized.<br/>
		Off: Never display images synchronized.<br/>
		To display the image feed of a camera, press the Add Camera button. You will be asked to enter a host name, which is the address of the camera server. The host name is usually "localhost" or "127.0.0.1". You will also need to enter a port number, this is the port that the camera server is listening on.</p>
		
<p>Running the server<br/>
Server.jar needs to run from the terminal. Use <code>cd</code> to navigate to the folder containing server.jar using the terminal. It accepts 0, 1 or 3 arguments. Here are some examples<br/>
<code>java -jar server.jar</code>: The server uses a fake camera to grab images and listens on port 1337.<br/>
<code>java -jar server.jar 1000</code>: The server uses a fake camera to grab images and listens on port 1000.<br/>
<code>java -jar server.jar 1000 argus-1.student.lth.se 6666</code>: The server grabs images from a cameraproxy on argus-1.student.lth.se. The server tries to reach the cameraproxy on port 6666 and listens for the client on port 1000.<br/>
The server will also host a http server. The port number for the http server is the same as the server port + 1. So if the server listens on port 1000, the http server can be accessed at port 1001 by typing "127.0.0.1:1001" in your browser for example.<br/>



		<h2>UML diagram for <code>realtime.client</code></h2>
		<img src="client.gif" class="uml" alt="realtime.client">

		<h3><code>public class RunFromThisClass</code></h3>
		<p><code>main</code> method, starts the client.</p>

		<h3><code>public class RawImage</code></h3>
		<p><code>image[]</code><br/>Byte array for a jpeg.<br/><br/>
		<code>timestamp</code><br/>Long containing the timestamp for when the jpeg was 			created.<br/><br/>
		<code>camIndex</code><br/>Index for what camera the jpeg came from.<br/><br/>
		<code>delay</code><br/>The response time for the server.</p>

		<h3><code>public class Buffer extends Observable</code></h3>

<p><code>public synchronized void setMode(int mode, int sourceCamera)<br/>
public synchronized void setGuiMode(int mode)</code><br/>
Both these methods sends a message to the each of the camera servers and tells them
which mode is currently running.
<br/><br/>
<code>public synchronized ArrayList&lt;RawImage&gt; getImagesSync()</code><br/>
When called it returns the most recent taken image from each camera. It calls on
<code>waitForImagesAvailable()</code> which makes sure there are pictures from each camera. If not, it simply waits.

		<h3><code>public class DisplayHandler extends Thread</code></h3>
		<p><code>DisplayHandler</code>	 is a thread which handles when to draw pictures on the gui.<br/><br/>

<code>public void run()</code><br/>
<code>DisplayHandler</code> draws image depending on the current mode the cameras are running.
If it's not on synch or only one of the cameras contains pictures. It simply gets
and makes the gui draw the pictures as fast as possible.<br/><br/>
If the synch is on, <code>DisplayHandler</code> gets one picture of each camera from the buffer and
it calculates the difference between the two pictures. It then posts the one picture 
taken first and waits the time difference. While <code>DisplayHandler</code> is waiting it's looking
for new pictures from the camera that has already posted it's picture to post. When the
waiting time has been fullfilled, it tells the gui to draw the later picture.</p>

		<h3><code>public class GUI extends JFrame implements Observer</code></h3>
		<p><code>public void refreshPanel(RawImage image)</code><br/>
This method is called if the gui should update it's camera picturs. 
<br/><br/>
<code>public void update(Observable arg0, Object arg1)</code><br/>
The gui is observing the buffer class. When mode is changed in buffer
whis method is called which updates the showing mode in the gui.
<br/><br/>
Rest of the methods and private classes are just for creating the gui
or handling events.</p>

		<h3><code>public class CameraConnection</code></h3>
		<p></p>

		<h3><code>public class ReceiverThread extends Thread</code></h3>
		<p>A thread class which retrieves messages from the server and puts to the client.</p>

		<h3><code>public class SenderThread extends Thread</code></h3>
		<p>A thread class which gets messages from the client and sends to the server.
</p>

		<h3><code>public class OpCodes</code></h3>
		<p>Contains operation codes for identifying different kinds of packages sent between server and client.</p>

		<h3><code>public class IntQueue</code></h3>
		<p>Replacement for an <code>ArrayDeque</code>. Needed in order to be able to compile to C code</p>

		<h3><code>public class ImageRetriever extends Thread</code></h3>
		<p>Thread constantly retrieving images from the camera, offering them to the monitor. Also checks for motiondetection and keeps the monitor updated on any changes.</p>
